Game can be played here: https://aralsea60.itch.io/food-smashing-everlasting


How to Play:
- Beware! Different varieties of food have gone rogue and are now jumping out of barrels of their own free will. It is up to you to destroy them (left click on each one) before they fall back down and cause more mayhem. Watch out for the watermelon though! It will require you to remove multiple bites from it (left click on it four times) before it can be destroyed.

- Luckily, you will have access to a special potion that will jump out of from a unique barrel on the right-hand side of the platform. When you destroy this (left click on it once), time will be temporarily slowed down. Why is this happening? Don't ask questions, just kill the food!

- Earn as many points as possible by destroying the different varieties of food before the five-minute timer runs out. Let the carnage begin!
